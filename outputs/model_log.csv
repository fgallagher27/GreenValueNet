20/12/2023,~4mn,Neural network,"layers = 1, learning_rate = 0.01, epochs=69",no convergence,mse fluctuated between 0.2 and 0.3 with upward trend
20/12/2023,~4mn,Neural network,"layers = 5, learning_rate = 0.01, epochs = 69",0.1856,"training and dev set error pretty close, XGBoost results mean we are underfitting here"
21/12/2023,~4mn,Random Forest,Grid search,,killed due to long run time (>54hrs); xgboost is a better benchmark so random forest is less useful
22/12/2023,~4mn,Neural network,"layers = 1, learning_rate = 0.001, epochs=69",0.4056,hit 0.4056 at epoch 6 and maintained - perhaps stuck at local minima?

23/12/2023,~13mn,Neural network,"layers = 10, learning_rate = 0.01, epochs = 69",0.1813,increased number of layers
27/12/2023,~13mn,Neural network,"layers = 10, learning_rate = 0.01, epochs = 69",0.1825,added batch normalisation - server crashed on epoch 49

03/01/2024,~13mn,Neural network,"layers = 10, learning_rate = 0.01, epochs = 69",0.177,added he and glorot normalization in hidden and output layers
